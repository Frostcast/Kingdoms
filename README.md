<br>
The plugin of empires and champions! Let your players battle for land, might and bonuses!<br>
<br>
Being in a Kingdom now has more perks than ever! Have bonuses while you are in a kingdom! Utilize resource points to upgrade your Kingdom's perks and defenses!<br>
<br>
New way to siege others! There is now infinite claiming of land, but it can be attacked by others! Enemies will need to do /k invade, then they will challenge their opponent Kingdom's champion, no matter if the kingdom members are offline or online! If the champion wins, the invader's items will be lost, and the kingdom gets to keep the land! If the invader wins, the land will fall into their hands!<br>
<br>
There is also the Nexus Block. To place it, do /k nexus, then right click a block to replace it with your kingdom's nexus. But guard it well! The nexus is your central hub. Enemies can steal resource points from it even when the land is claimed. Enemies can't claim the land where your nexus is. The nexus allows your members to convert items to resource points: 1 resource point for each 10 items. Kingdom mods and the kingdom king can use these points to claim more land, invade or upgrade bonuses.<br>
<br>
All new admin commands! Permission: kingdoms.admin<br>

<b><span style="font-size: 22px">The Api</span></b><br><br>
Kingdoms can also be used as an API for developers to make sub-plugins of Kingdoms, for their own custom versions.
This can be done relatively easily by importing the Kingdoms.jar file, importing Kingdoms.class then getting information and setting data with it (Ex. Kingdoms.newKingdom(king.getUniqueId(), "TestKingdom"); )
