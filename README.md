Kingdoms

The github repository of Kingdoms (Minecraft plugin)

Kingdoms is a beta version currently. Kingdoms is a bukkit/spigot 1.8 plugin similar to factions, but with some different features. For now, I would accept bug fixing/lag reduction pull requests, along with feature requests that seem promising/essential.  

Kingdoms can also be used as an API for developers to make sub-plugins of Kingdoms, for their own custom versions. This can be done relatively easily by importing the Kingdoms.jar file, importing Kingdoms.class then getting information and setting data with it (Ex. Kingdoms.newKingdom(king.getUniqueId(), "TestKingdom"); )

I am relatively new to GitHub, so forgive me if I can't provide any building tools or other helpful tools. If you feel strongly that it is required, don't hesitate to email me at leothepro555@gmail.com to notify me.
